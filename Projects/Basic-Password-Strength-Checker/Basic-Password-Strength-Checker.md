## What did I learn?
 Programming Concepts
String manipulation: Checking length, presence of uppercase/lowercase, digits, symbols.

Control flow: Using if/else statements or switch to evaluate password criteria.

Regex (Regular Expressions): If used, this introduces pattern matching — a powerful text-processing tool.

Functions: Breaking logic into reusable parts.

Data structures: You might use arrays, dictionaries, or sets to track characters or score criteria.

🔐 Security Awareness
What makes a password weak or strong: Minimum length, use of symbols, avoiding dictionary words.

Common password weaknesses: Repeated characters, predictable patterns, personal info.

Limitations of client-side checking: Understanding that strength meters don’t guarantee safety.

💡 UX/UI Design
Feedback mechanisms: Showing users how to improve their password.

Real-time interactivity: Dynamic scoring or coloring based on user input.

Balancing usability and security: Helping users without frustrating them.

🔧 Practical Application
Real-world relevance: Nearly every app or site needs secure authentication.

Coding confidence: It’s a small but complete project with input, logic, and output.

Security mindset: It introduces thinking like an attacker (e.g., guessing passwords) and a defender.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

#### Header 4

*   This is an unordered list following a header.

##### Header 5

1.  This is an ordered list following a header.

###### Header 6

| head1        | head two          | three |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------|
| ok           | good swedish fish | nice  |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

<dl>
<dt>Name</dt>
<dd>Godzilla</dd>
<dt>Born</dt>
<dd>1952</dd>
<dt>Birthplace</dt>
<dd>Japan</dd>
<dt>Color</dt>
<dd>Green</dd>
</dl>

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
```

The final element.
